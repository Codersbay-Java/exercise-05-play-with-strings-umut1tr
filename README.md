# Exercise 02 Strings 
### Deadline 24.03.2022

Learn and use strings.

The tasks are directly in the code in `application/PlayWithStrings`.
Please follow the TODOs precisely. You can make additional methods as you like. You will not need to make new classes.

Stick to a clean style. Keep the naming conventions in mind and do not repeat yourself.

> Before you start coding take a look at the API documentation.
